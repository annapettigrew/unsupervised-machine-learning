Myopia Clusters

- In this Project I will be fitting data to a model and using clustering algorithms to place the data into groups and create a visualization that shares my findings.

Background
- A data science team of a medical research company is interested in finding better ways to predict myopia, or nearsightedness. The "team" has tried—and failed—to improve their classification model when training on the whole dataset. However, they believe that there might be distinct groups of patients that would be better to analyze separately. So I am asked to explore this possibility by using unsupervised learning.

- The csv provided is raw data, so I will first need to process it to fit the machine learning models. Then use clustering algorithms to explore whether the patients can be placed into distinct groups. Finally create a visualization to share the findings with the "team" and other key "stakeholders".


Project Parts:

- Part 1: Preparing the Data


- Part 2: Appling Dimensionality Reduction


- Part 3: Performing a Cluster Analysis with K-means


- Part 4: Making a Recommendation
